My real name is Long. I am from Vietnam. 

My codename (pun intended) is Kira Zero, aka kirazero17. [`kirazero17`](https://github.com/kirazero17) is also the my main GitHub username.

Obsidian 24 is the name of my tech blogging project, which include this site and a few other documentations that will come to be. You can find the source code of my blogs in the GitHub organisation [`LongKira-Obsidian24`](https://github.com/LongKira-Obsidian24/), which you won't be editing but cool to see.

## My brief history

I was the college student whose major was Computer Network. With a lot happened, I came across Cloud Computing platforms, System Administration, CI/CD, Containerisation & Container Orchestration, Software-Defined Networking, Low-level programming, and Reverse engineering. The last two are more like hobbies than something related to my career. Over time, I realise that I can't just remember everything, so, documenting stuffs that I would re-read later on or share with others seems like a more reasonable choice than keeping it all to meself.
